## Project Description

Our Vision: Promote fish farm cultivation using a sustainable manner while earning profit
Target Customers: Local Fish farmers

The Problem :  
- Many people don't know the benefits of doing aquaponics or doing fish farm cultivation.
- Even if some realise the benefits, they don't know of proper good resources to actually start the cultivation
- Once you start the cultivation, the current methods takes time and is prone to trial and error during the initial days
- You would need to manually go and check every often to ensure that the fishes are in good health  
- Even once the fishes are in good health, the seller don't know how exactly to market them to potential customers

 
# Our Solution
- Create a platform for a new individuals to start fish farm cultivation from scratch and earn a livelihood selling fish produce and also for existing farms to simplify their daily work.
- The platform will have both farmer and customer side, primarily focussed on the farmer side.
 
## For the seller:
- When they first logs in, if they don't have a tank yet, we'll show them resources and initial set of guidelines/curated training videos showing the benefits of fish farm cultivation,
	probable subsidies available, and ways to get started by choosing a fish, their feed etc.
- Else, we'll get the details of the tank and the fish in it.
- Use our API to fetch data showing the popular fishes available near the locality
	It doesn't matter if the particular fish is not suitable for the user's weather. That part would be shown in the knowledge base section if they decide to go forward with that idea itself.
- Once the user has decided to go forward with the approach and have decided the fishes they are ready to cultivate , we let them create an account in our app so as to track their progress. This way, they are encouraged to use our app as this would help solve a lot of their problems.
- Details like the tank name, the number of fishes in each tank etc are collected. We also show them popular sensors they can use and we offer to help them by installing the sensors and collecting data and having them be displayed in a Dashboard format.
- This would let them monitor various levels in their tank like pH level, Ammonia Level, temperature etc.
- Based on the fish data entered, we could provide notifications, alerts etc (eg: Breeding time will be reaching your fish, so do this.)
- Following these advice, the farmer should, in theory by now have a working fish farm which was started from scratch with us providing all curated resources and free installation of sensors and monitoring in our platform
- Now it's time for the farmer to make money off of their hard work. Once the cultivation has been completed, the farmer is prompted to add their produce to our marketplace.
- We'll show subsidies they can avail for various activities.

## For the buyer who would like to have fresh farm products

- Consider swiggy for fresh marine farm products
- The buyer can (log in and ) use our marketplace and search for a particular fresh fish produce near them
- This will show all the marketplaces selling this product near them.
- There will be a way to make orders from our app to this farmer
- Based on this order, the seller can deliver the produce to the buyer

## Our offerings
- No installation charges for sensors
- Our app offers features like monitoring and timely alerts
- Once they have started reaching a state for selling fishes, we offer visibility in our marketplace
- Basically everything to get one started with fish farm cultivation from scratch and make a living. These are our costs

## Revenue Model
- Can add max 2 tanks in free version
- Can connect max 3 sensors under free version in each tank. (Cost of sensor born by seller).
- Can provide transportation via marketplace under paid plan

## Incentive for farmers to continue use our app once they get habituated
- Visibility in our platform for even further growth as opposed to a constant set of customers they initially get
- The sensors are already connected and monitoring is already being done using our platform
- We offer transportation facility to customers from afar which may be very difficult for new farmers to provide, but is a very good way to attract new customers with our premimum plan.
